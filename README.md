# moo-music
MooMusic is a fun, browser-based tool that allows users to create short songs by layering instrument tracks (drums, bass, melody, vocals, etc.). Users can add beats, loops, or notes onto a timeline grid, play them back, and adjust timing or volume to produce simple compositions, no prior musical knowledge required.
